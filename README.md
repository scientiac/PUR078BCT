# PUR078BCT
Graphics for 2078 Batch of BCT, Purwanchal Campus (IOE) 

# Kitty Config
Since the `main.py` script gives the ASCII Art for scribble layout of all the names in the terminal. This was the configuration used in the `kitty` terminal to make the graphics.
```conf
font_family  Terminess Nerd Font Mono
font_size    20
modify_font cell_height -12px

hide_window_decorations yes

enable_audio_bell no
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The graphics are traced bitmaps of the screenshots from the terminal, not the screenshots as is. The program used to convert the `png` screenshot capture to `svg` and all the logos is `inkscape`.
